# Security Policy

If you believe you have identified a security issue with Bookit,
**do not open a public issue**. To responsibly report a security
issue, please email github@mariogarrido.pt. I will contact you
acknowledging the report and how to continue.

Be sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report. As with
reporting normal issues, a minimal reproducible example will help the
maintainers address the issue faster. If you are able, you may also
include a fix for the issue generated with `git format-patch`.

The current and previous release will receive security patches, with
older versions evaluated based on usage information and severity.
