How to contribute to Flask
==========================

Thank you for considering contributing to Flask!

If you want to contribute, please check the [issues page](https://github.com/mariogarridopt/bookit/issues).
There you will find all the things we want to be done.
Add your code to a branch/fork and create a Pull Request.

If you think something should be done differently or have a new feature proposal
please create an issue.

## Start working on an issue

It would be great if you could check up with me on the issue comments.
Sometimes we can discuss a solution in there before you start coding
and usually that leads to a quicker pull request turnover.

After that, go for it...

## On your Pull Request

Make sure you follow the template and run all the Code Quality checks.

More info on how to run those checks on your machine at [README](README.md)
