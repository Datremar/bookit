## Setup Dev Environment

This project need a database and two web server, one for the python API and the
second one for the nginx web server that displays the frontend.

Firstly you need to create a `.env` file with all the settings you prefer.
An easy way to do it is to just copy the demo file:

```bash
cp .env_demo .env
```

All these containers are provisioned using docker. To start the dev environment
just run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Your developer environment should be up and runing, check:

- API: http://127.0.0.1:8181/healthcheck/
- FrontEnd: http://127.0.0.1:8080/

**Usefull commands**:

- Turn on: `docker compose up -d`
- Turn off: `docker compose down`
- Migrations: `docker exec -it bookit-api dbmate --help`
- API lint: `docker exec bookit-api pylint "*"`
- API tests `docker exec bookit-api python -m unittest discover -s tests -p "*.py" -v`
- Container logs: `docker compose logs -f`

## Migrations

The project database is set up using
[Dbmate migrations](https://github.com/amacneil/dbmate), to execute the
migrations run:

```bash
docker exec -it bookit-api dbmate up
```

Any changes to the database should be provisioned using migrations. To
better understand now to create a new migration please follow the 
[Dbmate docs](https://github.com/amacneil/dbmate/blob/main/README.md)

## API

The python API is running on port `8181` so you can access it at:
`http://localhost:8181/`.

A health check endpoint is provided so that you can check if everything is
running smoothly: http://localhost:8181/healthcheck

## Frontend
